      This is a demonstration of an AI-powered proctoring application built using React and
      OpenCV.js. It detects faces in real-time using the webcam feed and provides feedback on
      whether a face is currently detected, if multiple faces are present, and the overall
      detection percentage.
    </p>
    <p>Try it out! Click "Start Test" to see the proctoring in action.</p>
